          <hr>
          <p>Endeavor is a new location app designed specifically for Windows, aimed at helping millennials discover new places and plan trips together. When I joined the team, Microsoft has just entered the hardware market with its Surface line of products a few years ago. While the hardware was doing well and generating a lot of interest, market research showed that users perceived Windows as old, hard to use, and not exciting. This perception impacted the sales of the Surface line of products.</p>

            <p>
            To overcome this challenge, Microsoft needed to generate excitement, especially amongst the younger user segments, about Windows and demonstrate its capabilities and features to users. This required a multi-faceted approach that included updating the look & feel of the operating system and the apps and building new features that align with the needs of new younger users.
          </p>

          <p>As the lead designer on the project, I oversaw every aspect of the app's design, from user research, information architecture, interaction design to visual explorations. I worked closely with my team to ensure that Endeavor would be a seamless, intuitive, and engaging app that would meet the needs of millennials.</p>

          <br>
          <p>One of the design challenges, specically around visual design, we faced when designing Endeavor was the resolutions of the location images coming from Bing was low. The team wanted to create an immersive experience for the places in the app. These low-resolution images looked pixelated when used as the background of the place cards.</p>

          <p>
            To address this challenge, we came up with an innovative solution: using blurred images as the background. By applying a blur effect to the low-resolution images, we were able to create a background that was visually appealing, while still retaining the original feel and aesthetic of the location.</p>

            <br>
            <p>It was crucial to create an experience that felt seamless and natural, with smooth animations and transitions between screens. So, the other design challenge we faced was the need to visualize the high dynamic and fluid experience.</p>

            <p>
              To address this challenge, I evaluated different prototyping tools and, eventually, encouraged the team to learn Framer and create motion prototypes. While the learning curve is not low, epsecially for designers without any coding background, everyone jumped on board after I demonstrated what the tool can do.</p>
