            <h4 class="project">Background</h4>
            <p>
                Microsoft released HoloLens one in 2016. Windows inbox apps were
                moved to the Windows NEXT org with the goal to incubate new app
                experiences on HoloLens and Windows a few month before I joined.
                I was the senior product designer on the Journey team that owned
                the Windows Maps app and the location experience.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project">Endeavor</h4>
            <p>
                Endeavor is a new location experience designed for Windows and
                mobile. The project's goal is to incubate the solution that
                addresses the millennials’ end-to-end travel needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the lead designer on the project, I oversaw every aspect of
                the app's design, from user research, information architecture,
                interaction design to visual explorations. To make sure that
                everyone on the team feels involved and are on the same page, I
                pitched and organized a design sprint.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                As part of the design process for Endeavor, I worked closely
                with the user researcher to understand the needs of millennials
                users, their jobs to be done, and their pain points. This
                research highlighted the following user problems for millennials
                when traveling.
            </p>

                    Hard to find authentic recommendations that are tailored to
                    your taste.

                <li>
                    Need to use different tools to coordinate schedules and
                    preferences.
                </li>
                <li>Limited visibility of off-the beaten-path destinations.</li>
                <li>Overwhelming amount of content to share after the trip.</li>
            </ol>

            <br />
            <p>
                One of the visual design challenges we faced was the resolutions
                of the location images coming from Bing was low. The team wanted
                to create an immersive experience for the places in the app.
                These low-resolution images looked pixelated when used as the
                background of the place cards.
            </p>

            <p>
                To address this challenge, we came up with an innovative
                solution: using blurred images as the background. By applying a
                blur effect to the low-resolution images, we were able to create
                a background that was visually appealing, while still retaining
                the original feel and aesthetic of the location.

                It was crucial to create an experience that felt seamless and
                natural, with smooth animations and transitions between screens.
                So, the other design challenge we faced was the need to
                visualize the high dynamic and fluid experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                To address this challenge, I evaluated different prototyping
                tools and, eventually, led the team to swith to Adobe XD to
                build interaction prototypes and to learn Framer to create
                motion prototypes. While the learning curve is not low,
                epsecially for designers without any coding background, everyone
                jumped on board after I demonstrated what the tool can do.
