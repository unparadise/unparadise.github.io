            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
                Teams Admin Center is the website IT admins use to manage how
                users in his or her organization can use Microsoft Teams. It has
                approx. 270 MAU with 44.2% from small to medium business, 28.7%
                from enterprise, , 15.6% from small to medium corporation, and
                11.5% from education.
            </p>
            <img
                class="design"
                src="../images/simplify_tac/Teams_Admin_Center.png"
                width="100%"
            />
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">

            </figcaption>

            <p>
                The team has been tracking NPS over the past year. TAC's NPS
                (measured every month) has been hovering around 35 on average
                for all customer segments for the past year. In comparison,
                SharePoint Admin Center (SAC) has a NPS around 55 and Microsoft
                365 Admin Center (MAC) has a NPS around 50.4. It's obvious that
                TAC's score is behind both other Microsoft Admin Centers and the
                industry average. As a result, the business set the goal to
                improve customer satisfaction in fiscal year 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                The website's ownership is distributed amongst three primary
                teams. The Redmond team owned the framework, the high-level
                vision, the apps management, and security areas of the site. The
                Vancouver team owned the voice experience. The IDC (India
                Development Center) team owned the remaining parts of the
                experience.
            </p>

            <h4>My contributions</h4>
            <p>
                I was the lead designer of the simplification project and was
                responsible for driving the project from the creating the
                vision, pitching the project, leading the design iterations, and
                collecting customer feedback.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Analyzed and synthesized the NPS verbatim to identify themes
                    in customer feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked closely with PM and user research to conduct survey
                    to collect customer feedback on complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prioritized focus areas based on customer's JTBD, themes
                    from feedback analysis, and area usage telemetry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pitched the simplification project to multiple stakeholders
                    including PM owner and VP and received buy-ins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Led v-team experience audit to identify customer pain-points
                    and ensure stakeholder alignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Led design explorations/prototyping efforts and iterated on
                    design solutions based on customer feedback sessions.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Identify the source of the low NPS issue</h4>
            <p>
                To identify the source of TAC's low NPS score, I started from
                NPS data. Complexity is the top NPS complaint from customers
                consistently for the past 6+ months.
            </p>

            <img

                width="100%"
            />

            <p>
                A deeper look at the feedback reveals that the complexity issue
                is more severe for Very Small Businesses and Small to Medium
                Businesses than the Enterprises. However, we decided to focus on
                the Enterprise customers given they importance.
            </p>
            <img
                class="design"
                src="../images/simplify_tac/MoM_feedback_by_segment.png"
                width="100%"
            />

            <h4>Started with hypotheses</h4>
            <p>
                With the top issue and customer segment identified, I started
                with a list of hypotheses based on my perception and
                conversations with other team members and collected evidence
                from different sources to verify them.
            </p>

            <img
                class="design"
                src="../images/simplify_tac/Hypothesis_01.png"
                width="100%"
            />

            <img
                class="design"
                src="../images/simplify_tac/Hypothesis_02.png"
                width="100%"
            />

            <img
                class="design"
                src="../images/simplify_tac/Hypothesis_03.png"
                width="100%"
            />

            <br />

            <p>
                The team agreed to focus on addressing the customer pain-point
                based on the number of feedback received.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Focus on the high importance, high-frequency, and low
                satisfaction tasks
            </h4>
            <p>
                Even after the team decision to focus on the top theme in
                complexity, the scope is still too broad. I worked with the user
                researcher closely to identify the Jobs To Be Done and the
                customer's satisfaction of these jobs in TAC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paired with the task frequency data from the telemetry, I
                pitched to focus on simplifying policy management in the first
                phase given its high importance, high frequency, and low
                satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h4>Zero in on the customer pain-points</h4>
            <p>
                Two of the challenges of the simplification project is the lack
                of actionable customer feedback and the lack of user research
                resource. Even though many customers complained that TAC is
                complex, few of them offered specific and actionable feedback in
                their verbatim. To ensure the team agreed on the problems, I
                organized multiple experience audit with the stakeholders to
                identify customer pain-points.
