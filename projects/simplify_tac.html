            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
                Teams Admin Center is the website IT admins use to manage how
                users in his or her organization can use Microsoft Teams. It has
                approx. 270 MAU with 44.2% from small to medium business, 28.7%
                from enterprise, , 15.6% from small to medium corporation, and
                11.5% from education.

                <img
                    class="design"
                    src="../images/simplify_tac/Teams_Admin_Center.jpeg"
                    width="100%"
                />
            </p>

            <p>
                The team has been tracking NPS over the past year. TAC's NPS
                (measured every month) has been hovering around 35 on average
                for all customer segments for the past year. In comparison,
                SharePoint Admin Center (SAC) has a NPS around 55 and Microsoft
                365 Admin Center (MAC) has a NPS around 50.4. It's obvious that
                TAC's score is behind both other Microsoft Admin Centers and the
                industry average. As a result, the business set the goal to
                improve customer satisfaction in fiscal year 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the senior product manager on the team, my responsibility
                includes addressing the immediate look & feel update of the
                inbox apps to generate energy and create product differentiation
                by discovering unmet user needs. Through user research and data
                analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for
                improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and
                multi-file editing tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio
                of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy.
            </p>

            <h4>Focus Sessions Feature</h4>
            <p>
                One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I
                pitched, incubated and led the development of. This feature
                helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by
                integrating with the Windows operating system to provide
                customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and
                ambient music.
            </p>

            <p>
                To create a multi-disciplinary team, I brought together
                researchers from Microsoft Research, product managers from
                Windows Shell and Lab teams, designers, and user researchers.
                Employing a hypothesis-driven framework, we identified user
                pain-points and collaborated closely with research to validate
                design concepts.

                I spearheaded the development of the Windows Focus Experience
                strategy and roadmap, involving key stakeholders from Windows
                Shell, To Do app, Your Phone, and MyAnalytics (now Viva
                Insights). This roadmap continued to guide the feature
                development even after my departure from the team.

            <p>
                Throughout the process, I actively sought feedback from internal
                stakeholders and end users, using it to iterate on feature
                requirements and refine product design.

            <br />
            <p>
                The result was a highly successful feature that has received
                positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The
                Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more
                productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos
                as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva
                Insight product later.

                    of things like exercising, studying geography, doing a

                    stories, etc.. probably bc of windows' focus sessions? it
                    helped me a lot to be focused" -
