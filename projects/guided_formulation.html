            <h4 class="project">Background</h4>
            <p>
                The Outlook team was pushing enterprise customers to adopt
                Outlook.com when I joined. The enterprise rollout began about
                one year ago. The progress has been slow given the product has
                not reached desktop Outlook feature parity. One of the top
                adoption friction areas was search.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the product owner of Outlook.com search, my goal was to
                accelerate enterprise adoption and to lead the long-term
                strategy of search experience. I created a roadmap based on
                business goals, customer feedback, and technology feasibility
                shortly after joining the team. One of the low-hanging fruits
                was Advanced Search feature which had high business impact,
                clear user needs, and relatively low cost to build.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project">Advanced Search</h4>
            <p>
                The Advanced Search feature was one of the top asks from
                enterprise customers. For example, one enterprise customer was
                using Gmail and reluctant to move to Outlook.com because of the
                lack of Advanced Search. All the backend work need to support
                Advanced Search already exists. The challenge is to build the
                front-end that is simple and familiar and works for Outlook for
                Mac. I formed a v-team with members from Outlook desktop and
                Mac. Togehter we researched similar feature in Outlook desktop,
                Gmail, and other products and created a solution that works for
                Mac.
            </p>

            <p>
                The speedy delivery of the Advanced Search feature in
                Outlook.com helped to convert one enterprise customer to
                Outlook.com while I was there. Moverover, the development model
                of shipping in Outlook.com also built the foundation of the
                tiered innovation approach the Outlook team still uses today.

            <h4 class="project">Interactive Guided Search</h4>
            <p>
                Additionally, I incubated and led the development of the
                long-term vision of the search experience. The interactive
                guided search feature was envisioned and developed in
                collaboration with Microsoft research. This feature allowed
                users to easily create complex search queries through a
                step-by-step process, making search more accessible to a broader
                audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outlook.com's search users can be categorized into two groups
                based on their behaviors. Users in the first group (approx. 90%
                of all search users) perform a simple search either based on a
                person's name or a keyword first and then refine the search
                query as needed. Users in the second group (approx. 10% of all
                search users) construct a more complex search query using a set
                of keywords such as "from:" and "to: " (E.G. from:
                jonathan@outlook.com). User research and telemetry data also
                revealed that about 70% of users in group one refine their
                search queries multiple times before they find what they are
                looking for. To do that, users need to constantly shift their
                attention between the search result list (bottom of the screen)
                and search box (top of the screen). Additionally, users need to
                switch back and forth between mouse and keyboard input.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, roughly 40% of the 30% users who don't refine their search
                query takes much longer time to find what they look for. I
                hypothesized that these users are either not aware that they can
                refine their search queries or not know the right keyword(s) to
                refine their search queries.

            <p>
                The inspiration of interactive guided search came from
                literature review and my structured examination of patterns from
                other products. The problem email search tried to solve is
                similar to search for other type of content. Informed by the
                mental model users have, I see that the stepped approach users
                take in image and video search could be a solution to email
                search users.

            <p>
                With interactive guided formulation, users can simply click on
                the additional filters above the result list to refine their
                queries. This not only greatly reduced the amount of time wasted
                on input mode switching and attention shifting but also improved
                search success rate by increasing awareness of additional
                filters.
            </p>

            <p>
                Delivering interactive guided search was no easy feat. The
                engineering team had spent years building a feature call guided
                formulation; the design team was risk averse because of its
                desire to move to a unified search experience across Microsoft
                products; user research resource was very limited. Just to name
                a few. However, I was able to build a multi-disciplinary team
                including HCI researchers from Microsoft Research, designer, and
                user researcher from the Compass program. I reached out to the
                user researcher in the desktop Outlook team and worked with him
                to test the initial concept. This initiative collected valuable
                early positive feedback from users, which helped to build
                conviction in the team.

                The release of the interactive guided search feature had a

                increased Search Success Rate by 3.6% and reduced Time to
                Success by 2.2%. As a result, this feature was later adopted by
                Outlook for Mac.

                Overall, my experience leading the Outlook.com search space
                highlights my skills in product management, strategic thinking,
                collaboration with cross-functional teams, and driving
                innovation. I am proud to have delivered critical features that
                improved the user experience and drove positive business
                outcomes. I look forward to taking on new challenges and
                opportunities to create innovative products that meet the needs
                of users.
