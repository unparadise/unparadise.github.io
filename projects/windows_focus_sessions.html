    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>My experience leading the Windows Inbox apps experience demonstrates my expertise in strategic thinking, product management, and user experience design.</p>

    <p>As the senior product manager on the team, I was responsible for identifying opportunities for new features and enhancements to improve the user experience across the product portfolio. Through user research and data analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and multi-file editing tools.</p>

    <p>Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy.
      
    <h4>Focus Sessions Feature</h4>
      <p>
        One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I incubated and led the development of. This feature helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by integrating with the Windows operating system to provide customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and ambient music.
      </p>

    <p>
      To create a multi-disciplinary team, I brought together researchers from Microsoft Research, product managers from Windows Shell and Lab teams, designers, and user researchers. Employing a hypothesis-driven framework, we identified user pain-points and collaborated closely with research to validate design concepts.

    <img class="design"  src="../images/focus_sessions/hypothesis_driven_framework.png" width=100%>

    <p>
      I spearheaded the development of the Windows Focus Experience strategy and roadmap, involving key stakeholders from Windows Shell, To Do app, Your Phone, and MyAnalytics (now Viva Insights). This roadmap continued to guide the feature development even after my departure from the team.
     </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the process, I actively sought feedback from internal stakeholders and end users, using it to iterate on feature requirements and refine product design.
     </p>

    <p>
      The result was a highly successful feature that has received positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva Insight product later.
