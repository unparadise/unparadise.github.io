      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><strong>Role: </strong>Senior Product Manager</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibilities: </strong>Feature incubation, feature design (with designers), and go to market plan.</li>

    <br><br>
    <p>My experience leading the Windows Inbox apps experience demonstrates my expertise in strategic thinking, product management, and user experience design.</p>

    <p>As the senior product manager on the team, I was responsible for identifying opportunities for new features and enhancements to improve the user experience across the product portfolio. Through user research and data analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and multi-file editing tools.</p>

    <p>Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy. One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I incubated and led the development of. This feature helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by integrating with the Windows operating system to provide customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and ambient music.</p>

    <img class="design" src="../images/focus_sessions/AoT_sm.png" width=100%>
    

    <p>
      Throughout the development process, I worked closely with designers, user researchers, and developers to ensure that the feature was user-centered, accessible, and met project timelines and budgets. I also collaborated with stakeholders and customers to gather feedback and incorporate their input into the development process.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was a highly successful feature that has received positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva Insight product later.
