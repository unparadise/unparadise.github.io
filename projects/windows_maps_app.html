        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Microsoft released HoloLens one in 2016. With the goal to incubate differentiated and unified app experiences across Windows and HoloLens, Windows inbox apps were moved to the Windows NEXT org.
        </p>

         <p>As the Senior UX Designer on the team, I led the Fluent Design System explorations, explored new ideas to integrate Maps app with Tab groups in Windows Shell, and envisioned new features to drive product differentiation.
         </p>
        
         <h4>Evolve Fluent Design System</h4>
         <p>The Fluent Design System, a new design system adopted by various product teams in Microsoft, was spearheaded and maintained by the visual system team. The team was workign on evolving the design system for the upcoming Windows 11. However, it needed further testing and adoption by the Windows Shell and apps teams. The Windows Maps app became one of the first-party apps to collaborate closely with the Fluent visual design system team to stress test, refine, and co-define the new design language.</p>
           
        <img class="design" src="../images/maps_app/fluent_before_after.png" width=100%>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Before and after applied the new Fluent Design System</figcaption>

        <br>
        <h4>Drive product differentiation</h4>
        <p>To drive product differentiation, we focused on 3 top user pain-points based on the Jobs To Be Done for maps users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenging to compare different places to make informed decisions.</li>
          <li>Difficult to search for multiple places of different type to plan an outting.</li>
          <li>Hard to plan a trip together with friends.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first user pain-point is comparing different places to make informed decisions. The Windows Maps app lacked an easy way to perform this task. To overcome this, I introduced the concept of pop-up place cards, enabling users to compare places by viewing their information outside the app window. This streamlined the comparison scenario and made it much more user-friendly.</p>

        <img class="design" src="../images/maps_app/place_card_01.png" width=100%>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">More stylized place card to emphasize business brand</figcaption>
        <img class="design" src="../images/maps_app/place_card_docked.png"
                  width=100%>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The ability to pop and dock the card makes comparison easy</figcaption>

        <br>
        <p>The second pain-point is searching for multiple places to plan an evening. While the Windows Maps app supported searching for specific types of places from a place card, the predefined nearby searches lacked specificity. To enhance this experience, I explored the concept of multi-tab searches, leveraging the tab group concept being explored by the Windows Shell team. With this approach, search results from one Map app tab would appear in another tab within the same window, offering a more flexible and efficient search experience.</p>

        <img class="design" src="../images/maps_app/search_results_02.png"
                        width=100%>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Plan multiple activites for a night out using tab groups</figcaption>

        <br>
        <p>The third pain-point is group trip planning. I introduced a powerful solution by connecting the Endeavor app with the Windows Maps app: Collections. This feature allows users to seamlessly plan and organize their trips by creating curated lists of places. With Collections, users can effortlessly save their favorite spots, edit and customize their lists, and conveniently share them with others.</p>

        <img class="design" src="../images/maps_app/collections.png" width=100%>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Save places in collections to plan and share</figcaption>
        
        <br>
        <p>The integration between the Endeavor app and the Windows Maps app ensures that collections created in either platform are synchronized, providing a unified and cohesive experience. Users can easily switch between the apps, seamlessly accessing and managing their curated lists. Whether it's researching and saving new places in Endeavor or navigating and exploring them in the Windows Maps app, the connection between the two applications streamlines the trip planning process.</p>

        <p>Through these efforts, I made significant impacts on addressing users' pain points and evolving the Fluent design language for the Windows Maps app, resulting in an enhanced user experience and a more cohesive and visually appealing interface.</p>
