          <p>Hello, my name is Frank Chen. I am a seasoned designer, product manager, design strategist with 10+ years of expereince working at the forefront of
            technolog from mobile devices back in 2008 to HoloLens in
            2017. Technology is a double edged sword and I believe that it
            is our responsibility to shape it so that it helps the
            individuals and the collective human race to grow and
            thrive. My hero is <a href="http://www.worrydream.com" target="_blank">Bret Victor.</a> You

         <h2><a>New location Experience on Windows</a></h2>
            <p>The Windows Maps app was originally built for Windows Phone. The desktop app was built later on to provide a connected experience for users. Then Microsoft devested its phone business in 2017. The Windows Maps app, along with a few other Windows applications were moved to the Windows NEXT org in 2018.</p>
            
            <p>The desktop version of the Maps app's engagement stayed
            relatively flat over the past year given the proliferation of the smart phones and the use cases of a mapping application.</p>
            
            <p>The team is tasked to reimagine how to help Windows users to have a better location experience. The new location experience focuses on bring
            people and friends together by integrating discovery and
            collective planning features in Windows Maps app and by
        creating a new standalone iOS and Android app.</p>

             <h2><a>Windows Maps App</a></h2>
             <p>Microsoft Fluent Design Language is a new design system the
             company is adopting. Windows Maps app was one of the first
             party apps that worked closely with the Flent team to stress
             tested, evolved, and co-defined the system. As the Senior UX
             Designer on the team, I helped to drive the direction of the
               new Fluent Maps exploration.</p>

             <p>I explored the idea of allowing more business driven
             customization of the place card which is something Google Maps
               does not offer. The hypothesis is that offering the
             businesses to customize their own place card is a value that
             will help to attract more businesses to add their information
             to Windows Maps. This then would create a virtuous circle that
             would eventually attract more end users.</p>

             <p>One of the scenarios the user often go through is to look
             for a few places and then compare them. There was no easy way
             to do that. In our exploration, we thought about the idea of
             bing able to pull place cards out of the app window. </p>

             <p>Collections is a feature the team came up with that works
             with the new location experience we were building. The idea is
             that the users can co-create and share the Collections both in
             the Maps app and in the new location app.</p>

          <h2><a>Spatial UI (HoloLens)</a></h2>
      
          <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
            platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
            other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
            HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
            explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
            Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018
            Microsoft Build conference.</p>

          </video>
      
          <p>I led the UX exploration and did the interaction exploration in
            3DS Max and worked with a motion designer to produce the final
            video. I also drove the team's patent effort and at the end of
            the project, we filed 3 patents to protect the IP.</p>

          <p>I started with the desktop Mail app. Broken it down into
          different functioning zones and explored how interaction with
            each functioning zone can be improved in VR/AR space. For
            example, the experience with the content commanding requires
            the user to use the 6-DOF controller to aim at very small
            button far away from where she stands. It makes the interaction
            error prone and time consuming.</p>

          <p>Here is another motion study showing experience from first
            person POV. The content is summoned to a 6-DOF controller to
            simulate "holding" the content naturally.</p>

            <h2><a>Generative design concept</a></h2>
      
            <p>This is a side project in which I experimented with using
        generative design to explore brand concepts. The goal is to
        convey the feeling of unique identity and connection. The tool
        I used was <a href="www.processing.org">Processing.</a> Below are
        some examples of the type of visual patterns that can be
        generated using the program.</p>
            
            <img src="./images/generative_design/1.png" width="600">
      
          <p>By reducing the connection length, the point size, and
            increasing the number of points on the sphere, the underlying
            sphere shape becomes more obvious in this pattern (below).<p>

            <img src="./images/generative_design/3.png" width="600">
      
            <p>In this example (below), with the number of points reduced and the
            connection length increased, the patterns looks very different
            from the ones above.</p>

            the parameters.</p>
