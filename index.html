          <p>My experience leading the Windows Inbox apps experience demonstrates my expertise in strategic thinking, product management, and user experience design.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As the senior product manager on the team, I was responsible for identifying opportunities for new features and enhancements to improve the user experience across the product portfolio. Through user research and data analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and multi-file editing tools.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy. One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I incubated and led the development of. This feature helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by integrating with the Windows operating system to provide customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and ambient music.</p>

          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I worked closely with designers, developers, and project managers to ensure that the feature was user-centered, accessible, and met project timelines and budgets. I also collaborated with stakeholders and customers to gather feedback and incorporate their input into the development process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The result was a highly successful feature that has received positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva Insight product later.

            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>The Outlook team was pushing the enterprise desktop users to Outlook.com in 2021. One of the feedback the team heard from the enterprise customers is that search in Outlook.com is not as good as that in the desktop Outlook. I was hired to improve search on Outlook.com.</p>
          <br>
            <p>The team had a couple of clear customer asks (such as supporting advanced search) and had invested in a feature called guided-formulation. The goal of the feature is to help users to build more specific search queries. It surfaced keywords in the auto-suggest dropdown as users typed in the search box. The team had spent multiple years works on this.</p>

            <h3><a>Advanced Search</a></h3>
            <img src="./images/outlook/advanced_search.png" width=100%>

            <h3><a>Interactive Search Query Formulation</a></h3>

            <img src="./images/outlook/Mac_Outlook.jpg" width=100%>
            
            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>After I had formed my hypothesis, I started to observe how other people search and to talk with friends how they search. Based on some preliminary research, I proposed the idea of a more interactive guided-formulation feature to my manager. He’s initial reaction was lukewarm. Seeing that I knew that I need to find more evidence. So I did three things. First, I reached out to Microsoft Research and share my hypothesis with a researcher who’s been working on email search. He confirmed my hypothesis and shared with me a study they did testing an idea similar to what I was proposing. Second, I sketched out a few comps and asked the user researcher in my team to see if he can get some feedback from the the real users. He took the concept to the enterprise customers through the Compass program and the feedback the idea receive is overwhelmingly positive. Third, I discussed the idea with the search ML PM. He was very excited because the user interaction in the new concept allows more relevant search keywords to be presented and reduces performance requirement.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>With the additional data from Microsoft Research, user researcher, and the partner team, my manager and Outlook LT became very excited about the feature. The feature started flighting just about 2 weeks ago.</p>

            <p>The Windows Maps app was originally built for Windows Phone. The desktop app was built later on to provide a connected experience for users. Then Microsoft devested its phone business in 2017. The Windows Maps app, along with a few other Windows applications were moved to the Windows NEXT org in 2018.</p>
            
            <p>The desktop version of the Maps app's engagement stayed
            relatively flat over the past year given the proliferation of the smart phones and the use cases of a mapping application.</p>
            
            <p>The team is tasked to reimagine how to help Windows users to have a better location experience. The new location experience focuses on bring
            people and friends together by integrating discovery and
            collective planning features in Windows Maps app and by
        creating a new standalone iOS and Android app.</p>

             <p>Microsoft Fluent Design Language is a new design system the
             company is adopting. Windows Maps app was one of the first
             party apps that worked closely with the Flent team to stress
             tested, evolved, and co-defined the system. As the Senior UX
             Designer on the team, I helped to drive the direction of the

             businesses to customize their own place card is a value that
             will help to attract more businesses to add their information
             to Windows Maps. This then would create a virtuous circle that

          <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
            platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
            other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
            HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
            explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
            Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018

            example, the experience with the content commanding requires
            the user to use the 6-DOF controller to aim at very small
