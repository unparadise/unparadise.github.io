          <p>My experience leading the Windows Inbox apps experience demonstrates my expertise in strategic thinking, product management, and user experience design.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As the senior product manager on the team, I was responsible for identifying opportunities for new features and enhancements to improve the user experience across the product portfolio. Through user research and data analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and multi-file editing tools.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy. One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I incubated and led the development of. This feature helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by integrating with the Windows operating system to provide customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and ambient music.</p>

          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I worked closely with designers, user researchers, and developers to ensure that the feature was user-centered, accessible, and met project timelines and budgets. I also collaborated with stakeholders and customers to gather feedback and incorporate their input into the development process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The result was a highly successful feature that has received positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva Insight product later.

           <br><br>
            <p>As the product owner of the Outlook.com search space, I had the opportunity to drive the development of critical search features that improved the user experience for millions of users. One of the accomplishments during my tenure was delivering the top customer asked feature: advanced search.</p>

            <h3><a>Advanced Search</a></h3>
            <p>The advanced search feature had a significant impact on the Outlook.com user base, and it even helped convert one enterprise customer to migrate from Gmail to Outlook.com. The enterprise customer was reluctant to move to Outlook.com because of the lack of advanced search feature. However, after seeing the capabilities of the advanced search feature on Outlook.com, they were impressed and ultimately decided to migrate their email services to Outlook.com.</p>

            <img src="./images/outlook/advanced_search.png" width=100%>

            <h3><a>Interactive Guided Search Query Formulation</a></h3>
            <p>
              Additionally, I was responsible for incubating and leading the development of an interactive guided search query formulation feature, in collaboration with Microsoft research. This feature allowed users to easily create complex search queries through a step-by-step process, making search more accessible to a broader audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Delivering interactive guided search query formulation was no easy feat, especially given the challenge of limited user research resources. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by working with the Compass research program to test the initial concept. This initiative enabled us to gather valuable feedback and insights from users, which informed the development of the feature.</p>

            <img src="./images/outlook/Interactive_quided_formulation_02.png" width=100%>
            
            <p>The release of these features had a significant impact on the Outlook.com search experience. The interactive guided query formulation feature, in particular, improved core search metrics - Search Success Rate by 3.6% and Time to Success by 2.2%. As a result, this feature was later adopted by Outlook for Mac and was even copied by Gmail soon after it was released.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Overall, my experience leading the Outlook.com search innovation highlights my skills in product management, strategic thinking, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. I am proud to have delivered critical features that improved the user experience and drove positive business outcomes. I look forward to taking on new challenges and opportunities to create innovative products that meet the needs of users.</p>

         <h2><a>New location Experience on Windows</a></h2>

         <p><span class="emphasize">Role: </span>Senior Product Designer</p>
         <p><span class="emphasize">Responsibilities: </span>Competitive research, concept explorations, information architecture, interaction exploration</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Endeavor is a new location app designed specifically for Windows, aimed at helping Gen-Zs discover new places and plan trips together. At the time I joined the team, Microsoft has just entered the hardware market with its Surface line of products. While the hardware was doing well and generating a lot of interest, market research showed that users perceived Windows as old, hard to use, and not exciting. This perception particularly impacted the sales of the Surface line of products.<p>
              <br>
              <p>
            To overcome this challenge, Microsoft needed to generate excitement, especially amongst the younger user segments, about Windows and demonstrate its capabilities and features to users. This required a multi-faceted approach that included updating the user experience of the operating system and that of the apps that came with Windows. With Microsoft leaving the mobile business, I knew that we need to focus on creating unique customer value that is hard for the phones to deliver.
          </p> 
          <br>
          <p>As the lead designer on the project, I oversaw every aspect of the app's design, from user research, information architecture, interaction design to visual explorations. I worked closely with my team to ensure that Endeavor would be a seamless, intuitive, and engaging app that would meet the needs of our target audience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of the design challenges we faced when developing Endeavor was the need to use low-resolution images from Bing as the background for the app. These low-resolution images were not suitable for use as a background image, as they would appear pixelated and blurry on high-resolution displays, detracting from the overall user experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            To address this challenge, we came up with an innovative solution: using blurred images as the background. By applying a blur effect to the low-resolution images, we were able to create a background that was visually appealing, while still retaining the original feel and aesthetic of the location.</p>

           width=100%>
            <img src="./images/new_location_exp/skydine_card.png" width=100%>
      
            <p>It was crucial to create an experience that felt seamless and natural, with smooth animations and transitions between screens. So, the other design challenge we faced was the need to visualize the high dynamic and fluid experience. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              To address this challenge, I encouraged the team to learn Framer and create motion prototypes. Framer is a powerful tool that allows designers to create high-fidelity motion studies and interactive prototypes, which can help to visualize complex animations and transitions.</p>

             <p>Microsoft Fluent Design Language is a new design system the
             company is adopting. Windows Maps app was one of the first
             party apps that worked closely with the Flent team to stress
             tested, evolved, and co-defined the system. As the Senior UX
             Designer on the team, I helped to drive the direction of the
               new Fluent Maps exploration.</p>

             <p>I explored the idea of allowing more business driven
             customization of the place card which is something Google Maps
               does not offer. The hypothesis is that offering the
             businesses to customize their own place card is a value that
             will help to attract more businesses to add their information
             to Windows Maps. This then would create a virtuous circle that
             would eventually attract more end users.</p>

             <p>One of the scenarios the user often go through is to look
             for a few places and then compare them. There was no easy way
             to do that. In our exploration, we thought about the idea of
             bing able to pull place cards out of the app window. </p>

          <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
            platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
            other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
            HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
            explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
            Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018
