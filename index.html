          <p>My experience leading the Windows Inbox apps experience demonstrates my expertise in strategic thinking, product management, and user experience design.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As the senior product manager on the team, I was responsible for identifying opportunities for new features and enhancements to improve the user experience across the product portfolio. Through user research and data analysis, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement, such as the need for better screen capturing and multi-file editing tools.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Based on this research, I developed a roadmap for the portfolio of apps that aligned with the Windows strategy. One of these features was the Windows Focus Sessions, which I incubated and led the development of. This feature helps users to be more productive and stay healthy by integrating with the Windows operating system to provide customizable work and break intervals, task tracking, and ambient music.</p>

          <img src="./images/focus_sessions/AoT_sm.png" width=100%>
     
          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I worked closely with designers, user researchers, and developers to ensure that the feature was user-centered, accessible, and met project timelines and budgets. I also collaborated with stakeholders and customers to gather feedback and incorporate their input into the development process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The result was a highly successful feature that has received positive reviews from users and industry experts alike. The Windows Focus Sessions feature has helped users to be more productive and stay healthy, and it has been announced by Panos as a game changer in Windows 11. It was also adopted by the Viva Insight product later.

            <h2><a>Outlook.com Search</a></h2>

            <p><span class="emphasize">Role: </span>Senior Product Manager</p>

           <br><br>
            <p>As the product owner of the Outlook.com search space, I had the opportunity to drive the development of critical search features that improved the user experience for millions of users. One of the accomplishments during my tenure was delivering the top customer asked feature: advanced search.</p>

            <h3><a>Advanced Search</a></h3>
            <p>The advanced search feature had a significant impact on the Outlook.com user base, and it even helped convert one enterprise customer to migrate from Gmail to Outlook.com. The enterprise customer was reluctant to move to Outlook.com because of the lack of advanced search feature. However, after seeing the capabilities of the advanced search feature on Outlook.com, they were impressed and ultimately decided to migrate their email services to Outlook.com.</p>

            <img src="./images/outlook/advanced_search.png" width=100%>

            <h3><a>Interactive Guided Search Query Formulation</a></h3>
            <p>
              Additionally, I was responsible for incubating and leading the development of an interactive guided search query formulation feature, in collaboration with Microsoft research. This feature allowed users to easily create complex search queries through a step-by-step process, making search more accessible to a broader audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Delivering interactive guided search query formulation was no easy feat, especially given the challenge of limited user research resources. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by working with the Compass research program to test the initial concept. This initiative enabled us to gather valuable feedback and insights from users, which informed the development of the feature.</p>

            <img src="./images/outlook/Interactive_quided_formulation_02.png" width=100%>
            
            <p>The release of these features had a significant impact on the Outlook.com search experience. The interactive guided query formulation feature, in particular, improved core search metrics - Search Success Rate by 3.6% and Time to Success by 2.2%. As a result, this feature was later adopted by Outlook for Mac and was even copied by Gmail soon after it was released.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Overall, my experience leading the Outlook.com search innovation highlights my skills in product management, strategic thinking, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. I am proud to have delivered critical features that improved the user experience and drove positive business outcomes. I look forward to taking on new challenges and opportunities to create innovative products that meet the needs of users.</p>

            <p>The Windows Maps app was originally built for Windows Phone. The desktop app was built later on to provide a connected experience for users. Then Microsoft devested its phone business in 2017. The Windows Maps app, along with a few other Windows applications were moved to the Windows NEXT org in 2018.</p>
            
            <p>The desktop version of the Maps app's engagement stayed
            relatively flat over the past year given the proliferation of the smart phones and the use cases of a mapping application.</p>
            
            <p>The team is tasked to reimagine how to help Windows users to have a better location experience. The new location experience focuses on bring
            people and friends together by integrating discovery and
            collective planning features in Windows Maps app and by
        creating a new standalone iOS and Android app.</p>

             <h2><a>Windows Maps App</a></h2>
             <p>Microsoft Fluent Design Language is a new design system the
             company is adopting. Windows Maps app was one of the first
             party apps that worked closely with the Flent team to stress
             tested, evolved, and co-defined the system. As the Senior UX
             Designer on the team, I helped to drive the direction of the
               new Fluent Maps exploration.</p>

             <p>I explored the idea of allowing more business driven
             customization of the place card which is something Google Maps
               does not offer. The hypothesis is that offering the
             businesses to customize their own place card is a value that
             will help to attract more businesses to add their information
             to Windows Maps. This then would create a virtuous circle that
             would eventually attract more end users.</p>

          <h2><a>Spatial UI (HoloLens)</a></h2>
      
          <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
            platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
            other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
            HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
            explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
            Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018
            Microsoft Build conference.</p>

          <p>I led the UX exploration and did the interaction exploration in
            3DS Max and worked with a motion designer to produce the final
            video. I also drove the team's patent effort and at the end of

            each functioning zone can be improved in VR/AR space. For
            example, the experience with the content commanding requires
            the user to use the 6-DOF controller to aim at very small
            button far away from where she stands. It makes the interaction
