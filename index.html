          <p>Hello, my name is Frank Chen. I am a seasoned designer, product manager, design strategist with 10+ years of expereince working at the forefront of
            technolog from mobile devices back in 2008 to HoloLens in
            2017. Technology is a double edged sword and I believe that it
            is our responsibility to shape it so that it helps the
            individuals and the collective human race to grow and
            thrive. My hero is <a href="http://www.worrydream.com" target="_blank">Bret Victor.</a> You

          <p><span class="emphasize">Situation</span></p>
          <p>The team owned a set of Windows inbox apps including Alarms & Clock, Calculator, Groove Music, Maps, Movies & TV, Notepad, and Voice Recorder when I joined. We were focusing on two features - Graphing Calculator and Apps on demand. While both projects were important, I felt that we, as a team, lacked a longer-term vision of what we want to do with these apps.</p>

          <img src="./images/focus_sessions/Active_session_sm.png" width=100%>
          <img src="./images/focus_sessions/AoT_sm.png" width=100%>

          <p><span class="emphasize">Actions</span></p>
          <p>So I started to examine the portfolio of apps and understand who uses them and why. Many of the inbox apps were developed when the Windows Phone business existed. As a result, a lot of the core scenarios in the inbox apps are focus on mobile. With smart phone becomes more and more pervasive, especially for information worker. I asked the hard question of why would the users use these apps? I started by going through users feedback and talking to customers. I besides understanding the current user base of these apps, I also reached out to multiple research teams in Microsoft to get a better understanding of trends and other teams' priorities.</p>
          
          <p>Through multiple conversations, I discovered that one of the top pain-points of Windows is distraction. Many users have told us that it's hard to focus and be productive. A normal information worker gets distracted every 3 mins. It takes one up to 25 mins to refocus after being distracted. I knew this is a problem users need help.</p>

          <p><span class="emphasize">Impact</span></p>
          <p>The focus sessions feature was announced by Panos as a gamer changer in Windows 11 on August 5, 2021. It was rolled out to users on August 19. Feedback from the media and users have been really positive. Below are a few examples.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>"The Alarms & Clock app in Windows 11 is a bona fide, built-in productivity tool, thanks to its Focus Sessions feature" - <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-use-windows-11-focus-sessions">PC Magazine</a></li>

            <h2><a>Interactive Search Query Formulation</a></h2>

            <p><span class="emphasize">Role: </span>Senior Product Manager</p>

            <p><span class="emphasize">Situation</span></p>
            <p>The Outlook team was pushing the enterprise desktop users to Outlook.com in 2021. One of the feedback the team heard from the enterprise customers is that search in Outlook.com is not as good as that in the desktop Outlook. I was hired to improve search on Outlook.com.</p>

            <p>The team had a couple of clear customer asks (such as supporting advanced search) and had invested in a feature called guided-formulation. The goal of the feature is to help users to build more specific search queries. It surfaced keywords in the auto-suggest dropdown as users typed in the search box. The team had spent multiple years works on this.</p>

            <img src="./images/interactive_search_query_formulation/Outlook_released_feature_01.png" width=100%>
            <img src="./images/interactive_search_query_formulation/Outlook_released_feature_02.png" width=100%>
            
            <p><span class="emphasize">Actions</span></p>
            <p>After I had formed my hypothesis, I started to observe how other people search and to talk with friends how they search. Based on some preliminary research, I proposed the idea of a more interactive guided-formulation feature to my manager. He’s initial reaction was lukewarm. Seeing that I knew that I need to find more evidence. So I did three things. First, I reached out to Microsoft Research and share my hypothesis with a researcher who’s been working on email search. He confirmed my hypothesis and shared with me a study they did testing an idea similar to what I was proposing. Second, I sketched out a few comps and asked the user researcher in my team to see if he can get some feedback from the the real users. He took the concept to the enterprise customers through the Compass program and the feedback the idea receive is overwhelmingly positive. Third, I discussed the idea with the search ML PM. He was very excited because the user interaction in the new concept allows more relevant search keywords to be presented and reduces performance requirement.</p>

            <p><span class="emphasize">Impact</span></p>
            <p>With the additional data from Microsoft Research, user researcher, and the partner team, my manager and Outlook LT became very excited about the feature. The feature started flighting just about 2 weeks ago.</p>

            <p>The Windows Maps app was originally built for Windows Phone. The desktop app was built later on to provide a connected experience for users. Then Microsoft devested its phone business in 2017. The Windows Maps app, along with a few other Windows applications were moved to the Windows NEXT org in 2018.</p>
            
            <p>The desktop version of the Maps app's engagement stayed
            relatively flat over the past year given the proliferation of the smart phones and the use cases of a mapping application.</p>
            
            <p>The team is tasked to reimagine how to help Windows users to have a better location experience. The new location experience focuses on bring
            people and friends together by integrating discovery and
            collective planning features in Windows Maps app and by
        creating a new standalone iOS and Android app.</p>

             <p>Microsoft Fluent Design Language is a new design system the
             company is adopting. Windows Maps app was one of the first
             party apps that worked closely with the Flent team to stress
             tested, evolved, and co-defined the system. As the Senior UX
             Designer on the team, I helped to drive the direction of the
               new Fluent Maps exploration.</p>

             <p>I explored the idea of allowing more business driven

               does not offer. The hypothesis is that offering the
             businesses to customize their own place card is a value that
             will help to attract more businesses to add their information
             to Windows Maps. This then would create a virtuous circle that
             would eventually attract more end users.</p>

             to do that. In our exploration, we thought about the idea of
             bing able to pull place cards out of the app window. </p>

          <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
            platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
            other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
            HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
            explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
            Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018
            Microsoft Build conference.</p>

            video. I also drove the team's patent effort and at the end of

            example, the experience with the content commanding requires
            the user to use the 6-DOF controller to aim at very small
            button far away from where she stands. It makes the interaction
            error prone and time consuming.</p>
